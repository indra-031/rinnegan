## 🕶️ Hacker Notes
First blood matters. Speed + accuracy = impact.

Use --dry-run while tuning templates to avoid spamming your Telegram or Discord groups.

If Telegram refuses messages, check:

Token validity

Chat ID correctness

Bot permissions (make the bot admin or disable privacy mode via BotFather)

Keep tokens secure:

Use a .env file (ignored by git)

Or store secrets in CI/CD environment variables

Never commit tokens publicly

## 🛡️ Security & Etiquette
Respect platforms' Terms of Service.

Prefer official APIs when available.

Don’t abuse frequency — keep requests polite, rate-limited, and cached.

-Use responsibly and follow each program’s disclosure policy.

-This tool helps discover programs — what you do next is your responsibility.
